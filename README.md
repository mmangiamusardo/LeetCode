Welcome to my LeetCode solutions repository! 🚀
This repository is the personal gym for many problems presented on LeetCode. I do it for two main reasons: 
1) Hobby. Yes, it's a hobby. If I ask myself: How did you start programming? I started because I liked to solve problems and puzzles.
2) Brain health. I want to take my programming skills well-oiled through the years. As a software developer, I wear many hats. From architectures to raw coding, from testing to query optimization, from bug fixing to devOps problems. But I cannot accept the idea of losing all the happYness, security and self-confidence when solving tricky programming problems. Stay young!
3) Coding interview. A serious position in software development cannot skip some questions about the basics of coding. Maybe not full or complex algorithms, IMO, verifying the mindset to solve a problem could be an indicator of how a developer approaches or investigates it.
